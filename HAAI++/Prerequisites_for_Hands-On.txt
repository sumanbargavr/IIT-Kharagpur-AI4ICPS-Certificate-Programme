OpenAI Account and API Key Generation
--------------------------------------
1. Go to the OpenAI website: https://platform.openai.com/

2. Log in or sign up:

   > Click "Log in" if you already have an account.
   > Click "Sign up" to create a new account.

3. Navigate to the API Keys page:

   > Click your profile icon in the top-right corner.
   > Select "API Keys" from the dropdown menu.
   > Or go directly to: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

4. Create a new key:

   > Click on the "+ Create new secret key" button.
   > Optionally, name the key to identify its purpose.

5. Copy the key immediately:

   > The secret key will be shown only once.
   > Copy it and save it securely.

Note: You have to load credits (we recommend at least $3) in your OpenAI account using a Debit/Credit card.

Stable Diffusion
-----------------
Note: We recommend that you should have access to a CUDA GPU enabled system / cloud GPU compute platform.

> If you don't have access to GPU you can utilize the web-console provided by Stable Diffusion.

> If you have access to GPU: Install the packages and download models using the code below

PACKAGES:

pip install diffusers --upgrade
pip install invisible_watermark transformers accelerate safetensors

CODE:

    from diffusers import StableDiffusion3Pipeline
    from diffusers import DiffusionPipeline

    pipe = StableDiffusion3Pipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-3-medium-diffusers", torch_dtype=torch.float16)
    pipe = DiffusionPipeline.from_pretrained("stabilityai/stable-diffusion-xl-base-1.0", torch_dtype=torch.float16, use_safetensors=True, variant="fp16")
    pipe.to("cuda")
